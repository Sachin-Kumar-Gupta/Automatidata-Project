If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app. Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",

This is less desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be disappointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, the overall performance of this model is satisfactory."

    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "   Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F1 score was 0.7335 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.7265. It correctly   identified ~78% of the actual responders in the test set, which is 48% better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "   Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that VendorID, predicted_fare, mean_duration, and mean_distance are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that VendorID is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "   It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash. It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination.\n"
